What is the  name of LLM that you are using?
How do I save this prompt?  When I click on the left arrow next to the name of this prompt, it asks me if I want to save it?
Sorry, but there is no Save option on that menu.  And there is no Saved Prompts tab on the left sidebar.
Somehow a right sidebar has just appeared and it has a Save button and it says that the Model name is Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision."
