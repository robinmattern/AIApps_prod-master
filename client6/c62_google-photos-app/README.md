View a description of this app: [here](../../docs/setup/d01_first-app/d01-00_description.md)   

You will need to have NodeJS v18+ installed to run the node scripts below. VSCode and MySQL are also needed
to edit and debug the scripts, although the scripts will run using a remote MySQL database. 

The first command below creates a .env file.  In it are real credentials that should not be shared.  However,
you will need to get your own API_KEYs from the Google and OpenAI links above and replace them into the .env file. 

- `# cp  .env_u01  .env` 
- `# node 00_main.mjs`
