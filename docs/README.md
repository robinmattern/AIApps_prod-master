The pages below document my journey through the world of AI -- it's history, the buzz-words, the players and the plaforms.

## AI Repo Apps 

The applications in this repository have originated from tutorials I have found.  Due to the 
fast-paced development of AI, I had trouble getting them to work.  My first success was 
with the app **61). LLM Comments DB App** based on a tutorial by Adrian Twarog.

11). [Fine Tune BERT for Text Classification with TensorFlow](/setup/d11_bert-text-classification/README.md)  
12). [Gemini Pro Model App](/setup/c12_gemini-pro-model/Gemini-Pro-Model-Tutorial.md)    
13). [First Gemini App    ](/setup/c13_first-gemini-app/ai0103_Setup-1st-Google-Gemini-ML-App.md)  
14). [Text to SQL in CoLab](/setup/c14_text-to-sql/LangChain-SerpAPI-App.md)    
21). [Legal AIDocs App    ](setup/c21_legal-aidocs-app/d21-00_description.md)    
59). [Langchain SQL App   ](/setup/c59_Langchain-sql-app/c59_Langchain-sql-app.md)    
61). [LLM Command DB App  ](/setup/d61_llm-comments-db-app/d61-00_description.md)     
62). [Google Photos App   ](setup/d62_google-photos-app/d62-00_description.md)

## AICodeR Architecture

Here is an out-of-the-box (non-AI) architecture that will allow us to manage AI Assisted Coding sessions in order to build AI Assisted Apps.

Here is a diagram detailing how I got there
